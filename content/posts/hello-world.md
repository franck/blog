This is the beginning of something new.

I've been building software, raising a family, and learning about life for over two decades. Along the way, I've accumulated thoughts, lessons, and stories worth sharing.

## Why now?

At 47, I find myself wanting to document what I've learned. Not because I have all the answers, but because writing clarifies thinking. And maybe, just maybe, something I share will help someone else.

## What to expect

This blog will cover:

- **Rails development** - The craft of building web applications
- **Productivity** - Systems and habits that work in real life
- **Personal growth** - Lessons from stoicism, parenting, and experience

No schedule, no pressure. Just honest writing when I have something worth saying.

Let's begin.
